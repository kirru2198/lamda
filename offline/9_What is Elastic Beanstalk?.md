# 🎥 Introduction to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Hello everyone, and welcome to this video!

In this video, we’ll be learning about **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** – what it is, how it works, and why it’s useful for developers and startups.

---

## 🌱 What is Elastic Beanstalk?

**Elastic Beanstalk** is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** provided by AWS.  
It allows you to **create**, **run**, and **manage** your applications **without managing the underlying infrastructure**.

### ✅ Key Points:
- You can **directly upload your code**.
- AWS Beanstalk will **automatically handle the deployment**.
- It **provides a website URL** for your app.
- You can also set up a **custom domain** if needed.

---

## 💡 Why Use Elastic Beanstalk?

Imagine you're a developer who just wants to **write code**, not manage servers, networks, and configurations.

- If you're working at a **company** or running a **startup**, managing infrastructure can be a **huge task**.
- With Beanstalk, you **don’t need deep knowledge** of infrastructure.
- Just **focus on coding** – AWS handles the rest.

## 🧑‍💻 Supported Runtime Environments

Elastic Beanstalk supports **multiple programming languages and platforms**, including:

- **Python**
- **Java**
- **Go**
- **Node.js**
- **.NET**
- **Ruby**
- **Docker** (including **multi-container** Docker)
- **Java GlassFish**
- **Python with Corretto 8 and 11 (Amazon’s OpenJDK builds)**

This flexibility makes it easier to work with your **preferred stack**.

## 🔁 Beanstalk vs Lambda

| Feature | Elastic Beanstalk | AWS Lambda |
|--------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Type** | Platform as a Service (PaaS) | Function as a Service (FaaS) |
| **Use Case** | Run full applications | Run small, stateless functions |
| **State Management** | **Stateful** – can manage sessions or use databases | **Stateless** – starts fresh every time |
| **Runtime Support** | Wide variety of environments | Limited but growing list |
| **Infrastructure Handling** | Managed by AWS | Also managed, but for small functions |

---

## 🚀 Summary

Elastic Beanstalk is perfect for:

- Developers who want to **deploy apps quickly**.
- Startups needing a **simple deployment platform**.
- Teams that want to **avoid managing infrastructure**.

You upload your code, choose the environment, and AWS takes care of the rest.

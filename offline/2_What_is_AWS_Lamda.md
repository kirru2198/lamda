# 📹 **Video: Understanding AWS Lambda | Comparison with EC2 & Elastic Beanstalk**

## 📄 **Description**

In this video, we dive into **AWS Lambda**, a powerful **serverless compute service**. We'll explore what makes Lambda unique, how it compares with **Amazon EC2** (Infrastructure as a Service) and **Elastic Beanstalk** (Platform as a Service), and when you might want to use each one. Ideal for beginners and developers looking to understand cloud-native architecture and simplify backend workloads.

> In this video, we’ll learn about AWS Lambda, a tool that runs your code without needing to manage servers. We’ll see how it’s different from EC2 (where you manage the server) and Elastic Beanstalk (which helps manage apps). It’s perfect for beginners who want to understand cloud basics and build simpler backend systems.

## 🧠 What is AWS Lambda?

- **Lambda** is a **serverless compute service** provided by AWS.
- Your code is triggered in **response to events**, and AWS manages the **underlying compute resources** for you.

### Example Use Case:
- If a service (e.g. S3, Kinesis) sends an event or response → **Lambda is triggered** automatically.
- This Lambda function can:
  - Send messages
  - Create queues
  - Process files
  - Trigger other services, etc.

---

## 🔧 What Does "Serverless" Mean?

- **Serverless** does **not** mean there are no servers.
- It means **you don’t manage** the servers — AWS does it for you.

### Comparison:
| EC2 | Lambda |
|-----|--------|
| Dedicated infrastructure | No infrastructure management |
| You install OS, manage networking, scaling | AWS auto-manages it |
| Full control | Focus only on code |

## ⚙️ Lambda vs EC2

### EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- AWS provides virtualization; **you manage everything else**
- You choose:
  - OS
  - Network settings
  - Security patches
  - Instances, storage, etc.

### Lambda
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- You only write code — **AWS manages everything else**
- Just select:
  - **Runtime environment** (e.g. Python, Node.js)
  - Upload your code
- No need to install OS, libraries, or maintain servers

---

## 🚫 Limitations of Lambda

- **Language Support is limited**:
  - Only supports languages provided by AWS
  - EC2 allows **any language or framework** (because you control the full server)
- **Less customization**:
  - You can’t choose the operating system or instance type
- **Stateless**:
  - Lambda doesn’t retain any data between executions

---

## ✅ Advantages of Lambda

- Focus **only on code**
- Automatic scaling
- Cost-effective — you only pay for the compute time used
- Easily integrate with:
  - **S3**
  - **Kinesis**
  - **SNS/SQS**
  - **API Gateway**, and many more

## 🌱 Lambda vs Elastic Beanstalk

### Elastic Beanstalk
- You **deploy and manage applications** without worrying about the underlying infrastructure
- Slightly more control than Lambda
- You can still:
  - Choose EC2 instances
  - Choose the type of database
  - Customize environment variables and configurations

### Key Differences

| Feature | Lambda | Elastic Beanstalk |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Server Management | No | Minimal |
| Flexibility | Limited | More control |
| Stateless/Stateful | Stateless | Stateful |
| Resource Customization | AWS decides | You decide |
| Ideal Use Case | Event-driven, microservices | Web apps with minimal infra management |

---

## 🗃️ Stateless vs Stateful

- **Lambda (Stateless)**:
  - Doesn’t store data between executions
  - No persistent connection
- **Elastic Beanstalk (Stateful)**:
  - Can **store responses**
  - Maintains state over sessions or database

---

## 🎬 Conclusion

AWS Lambda is a **powerful tool** for event-driven applications and when you want to **focus solely on code**. However, for full control over infrastructure or stateful applications, **EC2** or **Elastic Beanstalk** may be a better fit.

# 📹 Distributed Application Architecture Explained

Hello everyone, and welcome to this video!  
In this session, we’ll be diving into **Distributed Application Architecture** — what it is, how it saves us time, and why it’s more efficient compared to a traditional (legacy) web application.

> In this session, we’ll learn about Distributed Application Architecture — a modern way of building apps where different parts (like the frontend, backend, and database) run on their own servers.

> This setup makes the app faster, more reliable, and better at handling many users at once, compared to older (legacy) web applications where everything goes through one main server.

## 🧱 Legacy Web Application Architecture

A **typical legacy web application** is composed of three main components:

1. **Frontend** – This is the user interface where users interact with the application.
2. **Backend** – Handles all the logic, operations, and connects the frontend to the database.
3. **Database** – Stores all user and company data securely.

### 🔄 How it Works (Legacy Approach)

- Users interact with the **frontend**.
- The **frontend** communicates with the **backend**.
- The **backend** fetches or sends data to the **database**.

**Problem:**  
If multiple users are trying to access different parts of the system (backend or database), they still need to go through the backend, creating potential traffic bottlenecks.

### ⚠️ Scenario: Bottleneck Example

Let’s say:
- 3 users are accessing the system.
- 2 users are interacting with the backend.
- 1 user wants to fetch data from the database.

**Issue:**  
The user trying to access the database must still go through the backend, and if the backend is overloaded, **everyone is affected** — even if they aren't using the same services.

## 🌐 Distributed Application Architecture

Now, let’s look at a **Distributed Application Architecture**, which solves these issues efficiently.

### 🔁 Key Difference

In this architecture:
- The **frontend communicates directly** with both the **backend** and the **database**, based on user needs.
- Each component (frontend, backend, database) is **hosted on dedicated servers**.

### ✅ Benefits of Distributed Architecture

1. **Reduces Traffic Bottlenecks:**  
   Each server handles its own traffic, so database users aren’t impacted by backend load.

2. **Parallel Communication:**  
   Frontend can route users to the required service — backend or database — without overloading a single point.

3. **Better Performance:**  
   Example: If 80% of users are accessing the backend and 20% the database, the 20% won't face delays anymore.

4. **Dedicated Servers:**  
   - **Frontend Server:** Handles UI, design, and routing.
   - **Backend Server:** Manages business logic and app processing.
   - **Database Server:** Stores and retrieves data only when needed.

5. **Scalability & Reliability:**  
   Services can scale independently, making the system more **fault-tolerant** and **highly available**.

6. **Improved User Experience:**  
   Users communicating with both backend and database can do so **simultaneously and smoothly**.

## 🏁 Summary

Distributed application architecture:
- Increases efficiency (= Helps things work faster and better)
  > Distributed application architecture helps things work faster and better by letting different parts of the app run separately.
- Improves system availability (= Keeps the app working more of the time)
  > It keeps the app working more of the time, even if one part has a problem.
- Reduces latency and delays
- Enhances the user experience

It separates responsibilities across different services and allows seamless communication among them. This architecture is the foundation for **modern web applications** and **cloud-native systems**.
